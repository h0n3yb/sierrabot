Great! I've successfully completed the initial setup tasks and found a comprehensive implementation plan. Here's a summary of what I've done and what I found:
I checked the URL which returned a zip file (not a JSON)
I downloaded and extracted the contents to the documentation directory
I created the .cursor/rules directory and moved all .mdc files there
I found and read the implementation_plan.mdc file
The implementation plan is very detailed and outlines a project for building an autonomous agent that translates natural language into Apache Spark code for PostgreSQL data transformations. The plan is divided into five phases:
Environment Setup
Frontend Development
Backend Development
Integration
Deployment
Would you like me to proceed with Phase 1: Environment Setup as outlined in the implementation plan? This would involve:
Creating the basic project structure (/src, /logs directories)
Setting up a Python virtual environment
Creating and populating requirements.txt
Setting up initial Cursor configuration
