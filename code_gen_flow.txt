Input: The process starts when the agent loop calls generator.generate_from_nl(request), passing the user's natural language request.
Schema Acquisition (Interaction with PostgreSQL):
Before generating code, the generator needs to know what tables and columns are available in the database.
It calls format_schema_for_llm().
This triggers _refresh_schema_cache() (if the cache is old).
_refresh_schema_cache() connects to your PostgreSQL database (_get_db_connection()) and queries the information_schema to get a list of tables and their columns/primary keys in the public schema.
This schema information is stored locally in self._schema_cache.
format_schema_for_llm() then formats this cached schema into a string.
Critically: At this stage, the generator only reads metadata (table/column names) from PostgreSQL, not the actual data within the tables. This is efficient and correct for informing the code generation process.
Prompt Construction:
The generator takes the original natural language request and the formatted_schema string.
It combines these into a detailed prompt for the Claude LLM using _construct_prompt().
This prompt explicitly instructs Claude to:
Generate Spark code based on the request and the provided schema.
Use the specific, globally defined function read_table(table_name) to load data (and not spark.read.table or spark.read.jdbc).
Include error handling and comments.
Return the result strictly as a JSON object with specific fields (code, description, etc.).
Code Generation (Interaction with LLM):
_cached_generate() sends the constructed prompt to the Claude API.
Claude processes the request, using the schema context, and generates the logic part of the Spark code.
The response (ideally the JSON string) is received.
Parsing and Packaging:
_parse_claude_response() extracts and parses the JSON string from Claude's response. It handles potential extra text around the JSON block.
generate_from_nl() retrieves the generated code logic string from the parsed JSON (generated["code"]).
It retrieves the tables_used list identified by Claude (generated.get("tables_used", [])).
Crucially, it prepends self.spark_prelude to the code logic received from Claude. self.spark_prelude contains:
Standard PySpark imports (SparkSession, functions, types).
The code to initialize the SparkSession (spark = SparkSession.builder...).
The Python definition of the read_table(table_name) function, which internally uses spark.read.jdbc with the correct connection parameters (read from environment variables).
It packages this complete code string, along with metadata like description and tables_used, into a GeneratedCode object.
Output: The GeneratedCode object, containing the full, ready-to-execute Spark script (prelude + generated logic), is returned to the agent loop.
Evaluation of Correctness:
NL -> Schema: Yes, the natural language request is correctly combined with schema information obtained from PostgreSQL before being sent for code generation.
Schema -> Spark Code: Yes, the schema informs the LLM's code generation process.
Spark Code Generation -> PostgreSQL Data Access: Yes, the generator correctly prepares the code to access PostgreSQL data during execution by:
Instructing the LLM to use read_table().
Including the definition of read_table() (which uses spark.read.jdbc) in the final code output via the spark_prelude.
In summary: The logic within code_generator.py correctly implements the desired flow. It uses PostgreSQL only to get the necessary schema information upfront, combines that with the user's request to prompt the LLM effectively, and constructs a complete Spark script that includes the necessary setup and the custom data-loading function (read_table) required for later execution against the actual PostgreSQL data. The explicit instruction to use read_table() and not spark.read.table/jdbc directly in the generated logic is key to making this work correctly.
